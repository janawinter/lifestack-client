# lifestack
Final project - Nikau 2016

lifestack is a platform for millenials to upload, share and view tutorial style videos of them attempting to master simple life skills they never learned in school. lifestack is gamified; there are four levels and members earn points every time they watch a video, attempt a skill, complete a skill and contribute to the site with a tutorial of their own.
